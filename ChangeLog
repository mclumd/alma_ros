10/1/2016:  changed message structure to view "Godel-codes" as strings
	rather than integers, since this is needed for named formulae.
	Also added a mechanism to allow for the loading of a file by
	sending load("XYZZY").  This is a bit of a hack and the protocol
	should probably be modified in the future.
